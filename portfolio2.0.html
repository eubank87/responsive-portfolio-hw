                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My career path has mainly been in retail and customer service, and began to really evolve in
                    2015
                    when I
                    received a big promotion from my previous employer, Columbia Sportswear. At Columbia I quickly
                    rose
                    through the ranks and became revered by most of my colleagues. Unfortunately, as my position
                    changed, so
                    did the landscape I was working in and I began to dislike my job.
                    Realizing it was time for a change, I have now started the journey to become a web developer.
                    With hard
                    work and dedication, hopefully I'll be able to have the same success in my new career path!</p>
